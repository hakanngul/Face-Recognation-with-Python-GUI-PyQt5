# Face Recognition System with Python GUI (PyQt5)

## Overview

This project implements a **Python GUI Artificial Intelligence Supported Face Recognition System** using PyQt5 for the graphical user interface and OpenCV for face recognition. The system is designed to perform face recognition tasks and manage student attendance records efficiently. The main window of the application handles model loading and face recognition, while the project includes a total of 14 different screen windows for various functionalities.
